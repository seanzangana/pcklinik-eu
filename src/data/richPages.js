  { q: 'My laptop shows no signs of life at all — is it definitely the battery?', a: 'Not necessarily — it could be the battery, the charger, or the charging port. We test each separately rather than assuming, since replacing the wrong part wastes time and money.' },
  { q: 'The fans are spinning but I see nothing on screen — is this serious?', a: "It's actually one of the more fixable scenarios — the core computer is working, it's a display-specific issue, which is often a straightforward screen or cable repair rather than a deeper hardware problem." },
  { q: "Will I lose my data if my computer won't turn on?", a: "Not from the fact that it won't turn on by itself — but if a failing drive is the underlying cause, backing up or recovering data becomes time-sensitive. We prioritize this if that's what diagnostics reveal." },
  { q: 'Should I keep trying to turn it on myself, or bring it in?', a: "A few basic checks (charger connection, a different outlet) are fine to try. Beyond that, especially if you hear beeping or see repeated restart loops, we'd recommend bringing it in rather than risking further complications." },

// ---------- General FAQ (site-wide, grouped) ----------
const FAQ_GROUPS = [
  ['General & Process', [
    ["Does home/contents insurance typically cover accidental damage repairs?", "Many home insurance policies cover accidental damage to laptops — worth checking your specific policy. We can provide a detailed invoice for insurance claim purposes either way."],
    ["Can you provide an invoice in English for expense reports or reimbursement?", "Yes — all invoices are available in English, which is useful for expense claims, company reimbursement, or embassy administrative purposes."],
    ["What should I do before bringing my device in for repair?", "If possible: back up important data, remove any case or accessories, and note your device's passcode if we'll need to test it after repair. Not required, but it speeds things up."],
    ["Do you offer any discount for students?", "Contact us directly to ask — worth checking, especially given our location near Copenhagen Business School."],
    ['Do you speak English?', 'Yes — our entire service is in English, from your first call or email through to picking up your repaired device. No Danish required.'],
    ['How does diagnostics and repair work?', 'We diagnose the actual problem first, then give you a fixed quote before any repair work starts. Standard diagnostics are 300 kr (2–4 days), or choose express for 600 kr (1–2 hours) — with repair and delivery within 24 hours if no special parts need ordering.'],
    ['What if I need my device back faster than standard diagnostics?', 'Choose express diagnostics (600 kr, 1–2 hours) instead of the standard option (300 kr). Most express repairs are completed within 24 hours if no special parts need ordering.'],
    ['Do you offer a warranty on repairs?', 'Yes, repairs come with a warranty. Ask at the time of booking for specifics on your repair type.'],
    ['Is my data safe during repair?', "Yes. We don't access or share personal data beyond what's necessary to complete the repair, and we recommend backing up important files beforehand regardless."],
    ['Do I need an appointment, or can I walk in?', 'Walk-in service — no appointment needed.'],
    ['Can you pick up and deliver my computer?', 'Yes, pickup and delivery is available — contact us for details based on your location.'],
    ['What if my device can\'t be repaired?', "We'll tell you honestly. If repair isn't cost-effective compared to replacement, we'll say so rather than charging for work that isn't worthwhile — and can point you toward refurbished or new options in our <a href=\"/shop/\">shop</a> if that's the better path."],
    ['How do I know if it\'s worth repairing my computer, or if I should just replace it?', 'A common rule of thumb: if the repair cost is more than 25–50% of a comparable replacement, replacement is usually the better value — especially on an older machine. A 2–3 year old laptop is almost always worth repairing; a 7–8 year old one may have harder-to-source parts. We give you our honest opinion as part of your fixed quote.'],
    ['What payment methods do you accept?', 'Card payments and bank transfer.'],
    ["Will using PCKlinik void my manufacturer's warranty?", "Independent repair generally doesn't void a manufacturer's warranty by law in the EU/Denmark, though it can affect coverage for the specific issue we worked on. If your device is still under manufacturer warranty and the fault might be covered for free, we'll tell you honestly — sometimes going through the manufacturer first is the better option, and we'd rather say so than take a job we don't need to."],
    ["Should I check my manufacturer's warranty before booking a repair with you?", "Worth a quick check if your device is relatively new — if it's covered, that route is often free. We're happy to look at devices regardless, but won't pretend a warranty repair path doesn't exist if it does."],
    ["What if my old computer isn't worth repairing or selling — can you just take it off my hands?", "Yes — we can take old devices for responsible recycling or parts, particularly useful for students leaving Denmark who don't want to ship or bin an old machine. Contact us to check if this applies to your specific device."],

    ['Do you repair liquid damage?', "Yes, for any brand or model. Liquid damage diagnostics work differently from our standard pricing — it's a flat 600 kr, takes 3–4 days, and there's no express option, since a proper assessment takes time. See <a href=\"/liquid-damage-repair/\">Liquid Damage Repair</a>."],

    ['Do you offer ongoing IT support for businesses, not just one-off repairs?', 'Yes — fixed-price IT service agreements with unlimited support, monitoring, and security. See our <a href="/business-it-service-agreement/">Business IT Support</a> page.'],
    ["What's the difference between a one-off repair and a service agreement?", 'A repair is a single fix for a specific problem. A service agreement is an ongoing, fixed monthly arrangement covering unlimited support, monitoring, and security for your business — designed to prevent problems rather than just fix them after the fact.'],
  ]],
  ['Shop', [
    ['Do you sell computers, not just repair them?', 'Yes — new and refurbished computers, plus backup and security equipment, are available in our <a href="/shop/">shop</a>.'],
